# Source Repository Analysis

## Task
Analyze the source repository structure and patterns to understand the codebase that will be migrated.

## Source Path
`./docs`

## Instructions
Migrate documentation files to a dedicated documentation repository.

Requirements:
- Convert markdown files to the target repo structure
- Update internal links and references
- Organize by topic and create proper navigation
- Add README with overview and usage instructions


## Analysis Requirements
Please analyze the source repository and provide:

1. **Repository Structure**
   - Overall directory structure
   - Key components and modules
   - File organization patterns

2. **Technology Stack**
   - Programming languages used
   - Frameworks and libraries
   - Build tools and configuration files

3. **Code Patterns**
   - Architecture patterns (MVC, component-based, etc.)
   - Naming conventions
   - Code organization principles

4. **Dependencies**
   - External dependencies
   - Internal module dependencies
   - Configuration dependencies

5. **Migration Considerations**
   - Files that will need special handling
   - Potential compatibility issues
   - Areas that might require manual intervention

## Output
Provide a detailed analysis that will inform the migration strategy and help create an accurate migration plan.
