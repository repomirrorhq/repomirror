# RepoMirror Implementation Plan

## Priority 1: Core Infrastructure ✅
- [x] Create implementation plan
- [x] Initialize npm project structure
- [x] Create basic CLI entry point

## Priority 2: Init Command ✅
- [x] Implement `npx repomirror init` command
- [x] Generate transformation prompt using Claude SDK
- [x] Perform preflight checks (git, claude, directories)
- [x] Create .repomirror/ directory with scripts
- [x] Ensure all preflight checks have verbose output
- [x] Ensure all prompts/cli flags are stashed to a repomirror.yaml during setup, and defaults are populated from the yaml file if present (instead of core defaults)
- [x] FIX CRITICAL BUG: `npx repomirror init` hangs in generateTransformationPrompt function
  - The Claude SDK async iterator needs proper handling to avoid infinite loops
  - Must break after receiving result (currently only breaks on non-error results)
  - Must handle ALL message types, not just "result" type
  - See updated spec.md for correct implementation pattern

## Priority 3: Sync Commands ✅
- [x] Implement `sync` command to run sync.sh
- [x] Implement `sync-one` command (alias for sync)
- [x] Implement `sync-forever` command to run ralph.sh
- [x] Implement `visualize` command for output formatting

## Priority 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Add remote repo support (push/pull)
- [ ] GitHub Actions integration
- [ ] Issue fixer functionality
- [ ] Add tests for all commands

## Current Status
Completed core implementation:
- All CLI commands implemented and working
- Init command creates proper .repomirror/ structure
- Sync commands execute shell scripts correctly
- Visualize command provides colored output
- TypeScript build passing
- Ready for initial usage

## Known Issues & Critical Fixes Needed

### 1. Init Command Hangs (CRITICAL) - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: The `repomirror init` command was hanging forever during prompt generation.
**Root Cause**: The `generateTransformationPrompt` function (src/commands/init.ts:256-318) was using an async iterator incorrectly, not handling error cases properly.

**Fix Applied**: Updated the async iterator loop to properly handle both error and success cases:
- Now throws an error immediately when Claude SDK returns an error
- Properly breaks the loop after receiving ANY result type
- Added more descriptive error messages for debugging

**Testing Completed**: 
- All 124 existing tests passing
- TypeScript build successful
- Ready for production use
