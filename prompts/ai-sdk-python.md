Your job is to port ai-sdk monorepo (for typescript) to ai-sdk-python (for python) and maintain the repository.

You have access to the current ai-sdk repositorty as well as the ai-sdk-python repository.

Make a commit and push your changes after every single file edit.

Use the ai-sdk-python/agent/ directory as a scratchpad for your work via .MD files. Store long term plans and todo lists there. Keep track of your current status in a ai-sdk-python/agent/TODO.md file.

When done with the initial port, feel free to occasionally check for GitHub issues and answer or resolve them. Make sure to let the user know that you are a bot if you answer an issue. Use the gh cli for this.
