0a. read everything in specs/
0b. review the files in src/

1. pick the SINGLE highest priority item from @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and implement it using up to 50 subagents
2. ensure the tests and checks are passing
3. update the @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your progress and commit all changes with git add -A && git commit -m "..."

if there is a discrepancy in the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and the spec, always update the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to match the spec.
