Your job is to port assistant-ui-react monorepo (for react) to assistant-ui-vue (for vue) and maintain the repository.

You have access to the current assistant-ui-react repository as well as the assistant-ui-vue repository.

Make a commit and push your changes after every single file edit.

Use the assistant-ui-vue/.agent/ directory as a scratchpad for your work. Store long term plans and todo lists there.

The original project was mostly tested by manually running the code. When porting, you will need to write end to end and unit tests for the project. But make sure to spend most of your time on the actual porting, not on the testing. A good heuristic is to spend 80% of your time on the actual porting, and 20% on the
testing.
